# Heart Disease Prediction
The aim/goal of this project is to build a supervised prediction that can be able to classify whether a patient is prone to Heart Disease or not using the variables collected as shown below
`age: Age of the patient (in years)`
`sex: Gender of the patient (0 = female, 1 = male).`
`cp: Chest pain type (0 = typical angina, 1 = atypical angina, 2 = non-anginal pain, 3 = asymptomatic).`
trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg).
chol: Serum cholesterol level (in mg/dl).
fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (0 = false, 1 = true).
restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy).
thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved.
exang: Exercise induced angina (0 = no, 1 = yes).
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0 = upsloping, 1 = flat, 2 = downsloping).
ca: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0-3).
thal: Thalassemia (0 = normal, 1 = fixed defect, 2 = reversable defect).
target: Presence of heart disease (0 = no, 1 = yes).
